================================================================
Frontend Developer | London | padraig.flood1@gmail.com
================================================================
Likes to work with React and JavaScript
Likes to have dumb side projects (the liberation of writing almost no tests!)
Likes to write efficient code and make fun things
Won a prize for a code thing in college and got good grades
Looking for projects to collab on and other fun stuff to do

===============
WORK EXPERIENCE (bit more serious)
===============
2016-2017: Frontend Intern, then a Remote Contractor -- San Francisco
I initially worked on designing the new mobile-first marketing site (Rails, LESS, ES5, handlebars) of a seed funded EdTech startup (now Series B)
Following that proceeded that with some small tasks migrating the core app's frontend to React
Upon the end of the visa I worked remotely from Europe continuing with these tasks with some more full stack duties on the marketing site.

2017-Present: Frontend Engineer -- London
Worked on the development of several react projects along with the introduction of a design system and migration of preexisting jQuery and WordPress frontends to React
As the most tenured frontend developer at the company I play an important role in the onboarding of new developers.


===============
KEYWORDS I KNOW AT LEAST A LITTLE BIT AND WOULD TOUCH AGAIN
===============
Strong:
JavaScript, React, ES6, Redux Babel, a11y, Browser APIs,
Resposnsive Design, CSS (obviously, look at this thing!), TDD, Jest,
Webpack, build tools.... I'm a bit afraid of leaving out stuff!

Less strong but have used and enjoy a lot:
Python, C, Ruby, PHP, Sketch, SQL, Vue... 

Not too keen on going near again:
C++, Twig, IE8 compatibiliy

Stuff I'd like to do more of:
Analytics, Go, a lot more backend, d3, a functional language, pixel.js, webGL
design, direct user engagement
